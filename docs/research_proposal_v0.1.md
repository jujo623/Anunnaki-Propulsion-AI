# Anunnaki Propulsion System – Research Proposal

## 1. Background
This project investigates the ancient descriptions of "fiery chariots" and "heavenly sounds" in Sumerian, Akkadian, and Indian texts. The goal is to model these phenomena using modern plasma physics, MHD propulsion systems, and quantum resonance theories.

## 2. Objectives
- Simulate a hybrid plasma-resonance propulsion system based on mythological texts.
- Explore quantum resonance (Casimir effect) as an efficiency enhancement mechanism.
- Validate cultural interpretations using BERT-based NLP analysis.
- Create interactive 3D visualizations with Unity.

## 3. Methodology
- **Plasma Simulations:** COMSOL Multiphysics, OpenFOAM turbulence modeling.
- **Heat Resistance:** ANSYS Fluent simulations for SiC/TaC shielding.
- **Quantum Resonance:** MATLAB Quantum Toolbox simulations.
- **NLP Analysis:** Sumero-Sanskrit comparisons, metaphor vs. technology matrices.
- **3D Visualization:** Unity engine, Stable Diffusion generated visuals.

## 4. Deliverables
- Validated hybrid plasma-resonance model (.mph files)
- Quantum resonance simulation scripts (.m files)
- NLP comparative databases (.json files)
- Unity-based 3D visualization prototype
- Full project documentation (Markdown and PDF)

## 5. Timeline
- Plasma-Resonance Simulation Validation: 2 weeks
- Unity Prototype: 1 month
- Quantum Resonance Integration: 2 months
- Final
