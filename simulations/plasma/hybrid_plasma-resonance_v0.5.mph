# Hybrid Plasma-Resonance Model - COMSOL v0.5

Plasma Parameters:
- Electron density (n_e): 1e20 m^-3
- Magnetic field (B): 1.2 T
- Plasma temperature (T): 10^6 K
- Plasma flow velocity (v_e): 1.3e4 m/s
- Resonance frequency (f): 20 Hz
- Acoustic pressure (P_a): 100 Pa

Boundary Conditions:
- Turbulence: k-epsilon model
- Atmospheric friction model included
- Surface material: SiC/TaC (high thermal resistance)

Goal:
- Simulate stable plasma flow with acoustic resonance coupling.

Note:
- Full COMSOL physics will be built in the final phase.
