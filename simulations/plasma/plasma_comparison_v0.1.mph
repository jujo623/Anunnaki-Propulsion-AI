Placeholder for COMSOL plasma comparison simulation (v0.1).
Comparison parameters:
- Mercury (Hg): Ionization efficiency ~85%, environmental risk high
- Xenon (Xe): Ionization efficiency ~95%, environmentally safer
Purpose:
Evaluate suitability for Anunnaki propulsion systems based on historical and physical analysis.
